I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I want to participate in the contest. I know how to solve problem A , but I can&amp;rsquo;t find a vital bit of info about the new rules like the CPU of the servers where the codes are supposed to run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this suspiciously sound like one of those badly made ACM contests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I no longer have so much free time as before. I barely have time in the weekends to rest. So a Saturday is not something I can just spend in some contest if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound at least a bit challenging. And the prizes are as low as ever. I decide that atleast for Friday I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna bother.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
