Basically good advice so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do something similar for programming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Normal Form Designators</title><link>https://breylaude.com/blog/2023-04-12-normal-form-designators/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://breylaude.com/blog/2023-04-12-normal-form-designators/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Brian Cantwell Smith&lt;/em> is one of the many people who are far smarter than I am.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their 
&lt;a href="https://publications.csail.mit.edu/lcs/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-272.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT thesis Procedural Reflection in Programming Languages&lt;/a>, which is something else, is how I first became aware of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As usual, I learned the concepts presented in this post from the aforementioned paper. As such, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I should give credit to Brian for these concepts, but I will since I&amp;rsquo;m not sure to whom to give credit otherwise.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
