Hopefully some new technical stuff soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Switched from NGINX to Apache2 for the website. Redirect to SSL should be universal now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if you have any issues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>May can officially suck</title><link>https://breylaude.com/blog/2024-04-29-may-can-officially-suck/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://breylaude.com/blog/2024-04-29-may-can-officially-suck/</guid><description>&lt;p>A terrible, terrible month for me on many fronts. However, I&amp;rsquo;m still here, still on board, and still not under indictment (that I know of). April will be better for me or I will set it on fire.&lt;/p>
