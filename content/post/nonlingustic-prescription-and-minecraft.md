As someone who has difficulty processing emotion and an amazing friend with low levels of emotional intelligence, it gives me hedonistic pleasure to realize that a seedling of a flowery feeling has managed to bud in the alien hellscape that is the folds of my brain, and that species is also alien to her.

#### Minecraft
When times are tough, there are few things more effective to my brain like the escapism offered in Minecraft. For however long I immerse myself in its pixelated world (sadly, the time seems to shrink with each escape), I can become completely immersed in a world void of the chaos haunting my mind, of situations I have not the resolve or ability to escape properly.

The blocks and creatures in Minecraft are fundamentally nothing more than a series of bits of data, given semantic meaning of whatever version of the gameplay. Yet, these bits transcend mere interpretation. They become vessels for our stories and internal mythologies. We prescribe temporal continuity to these specific series of bits, to our specific series of bits, to others specific series of bits.

We have tools that allow us to carry our creations and adventures across multiple worlds, and when those tools fall short, we innovate our own. We bestow a kind of soul upon our builds and characters, imbuing them with meaning that surpasses what the game itself can offer. We deem it necessary enough that we prescribe what amounts to a soul to these specific series of bits, beyond any capability any game has of doing.

It's not wrong to say that these bits evoke emotions within us, much like our relationships with other people do.

In which I vouch for more non-prescriptivist methods of intergame information sharing.

What is a game but a system of constraining some data such that one or more people can reason about it in a fixed and well understood manner. Our need for conformity, for assurance in a capitalist landscape of software production, has blinded us to the beauty that could exist.

We insist on enforcing a game's *"rules"*, forcefully snuffing *"hacks"*, and imposing severe conformity measures on CPUs. However, what is a house rule if not a technique of taking a previously prescriptivist program and changing the semantic meaning it conveys while keeping the input profile constant?

A **romhack** is nothing more than turning the conventional paradigm on its head, returning to the more liberating ways of processing one input on numerous interpreters, severing the connection that binds subject and object, and instead giving that power to the observer, the ego, the unique.

#### Limits of Computing
Alright. Halting problem, so on. Go touch grass.

Silicon Valley arrogance asserts that the software we use is our new diety, that it outperforms us in knowledge and capabilities.

Its marketing that drives tech companies to attempt to replace the churches of old, with product being the new Lord.

They would have us think that if we present our products, our series of bits, to this deity, he will bestow upon us a new series of bits, announcing to us the meaning and accuracy of these pieces.

The emotions in our heads and systems are chaotic, uncalculatable, dangerous, and beautiful, and they stem from our surprise when something is interpreted differently than we expected.

#### Fin
As always, I have no idea where I intended this to go, nor when it should end. I see it as my attempt to express how these blocks and mobs, representing funny little digital creatures, have made their way into my world. I've found them, lost them, traded them, altered them, corrupted them, and ultimately crafted them into many buildsâ€”some planned, some not. And through it all, they've cemented a spot in my mind, producing the good kind of "redstone energy."

It is my frustration with a computing system that constantly attempts to restrict the use of data in a prescriptivist manner, that ties the output to the program *intended* to interpret it, and that blatantly ignores the new emotions we as egos can impart to said data, the semantic meaning we impart solely for the purpose of experiencing and sharing it.

My aim is for a more freeform manner of making and sharing games, one that is easily modifiable, houserulable, and hackable.

Something we see as a technique of temporarily limiting our options, such as to aid creativity, rather than a set of laws that must be violently enforced.

Finally, I wish I understood my flawed brain enough to be able to communicate with my friends a way of feeling that has helped me through many difficult moments, and I hope to continue feeling that way well into the future, should any difficult situations arise again.
