Many modules written and others since other car manufacturers share the same code base. You can also find Toyota version as well.

I found it a year ago, made minor modifications and compiled successfully. However, to get it deployed is another large task which I didnâ€™t follow through with, there are probably people who have done so already, I am not sure.

Send me an email if you do. Cheers!
