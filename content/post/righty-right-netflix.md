Alright, Netflix used to be good, I know, almost even made Blockbuster look like a sad, ancient thing. But now? Jesus Christ, it’s gone all cal and lost its way, like me when I'm without my moloko plus.

### Welly welly well well
I’m not here to sugarcoat it. Netflix has become a bloated, overpriced, algorithm-driven mess. Remember when it was just a tenner a month and you could binge-watch some movie for the 47th time without feeling like you were being robbed? Yeah, those days are fucking gone. Now, they’re hiking prices like they’re selling fucking caviar, and for what? A library that’s thinner than my patience for their shitty original movies?

### Speaking of originals
What the fuck happened? Sure, they've had some good ones, but for every good ones, there’s a mountain of absolute dogshit. Like, who the fuck greenlit Bird Box? Or that 365 Days nonsense? It’s like they’re throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping something sticks, but most of it just slides the fuck off like a wet fish.

### Cancellation game, basically cancelled
LOL, They’re out here axing shows left and right. It’s downright disrespectful.

### Obsession with quantity over quality
They’re churning out content but most of it feels like it was made by an algorithm. “Oh, you liked one rom-com? Here’s 50 more, all with the same plot and zero soul” It’s exhausting. I don’t need 10,000 options; I need 10 good ones. Is that too much to ask? 

### Fucking ads
And the ads? Fuck off with that. I already pay for this shit, and now you’re gonna force me to sit through ads unless I fork over even more cash? That’s some greedy, corporate bullshit right there. No no for that.

### Fin
So, Netflix, if you’re listening (which you’re not, because you’re too busy counting your money and greenlighting another season of the absolute disaster *Too Hot to Handle*), get your shit together. Stop nickel-and-diming users, stop cancelling everything good, and for fuck’s sake, start giving us content that’s worth our money.

Until then, fuck Netflix. I’m out.
