This current trend in the web development industry, is probably familiar to you.

But pardon my skepticism, because I can’t help but wonder, is it really THAT groundbreaking?

The core idea behind Styled Components is to remove the ‘cascade’ from CSS.

And I know, cascading styles can be a headache. But, does eradicating this cascade lead to better, more maintainable designs? Fucking color me skeptical.
