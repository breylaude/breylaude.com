### 2024-09-16 Echelon Philippines 2024
I'll be in SMX Convention Center on Sep. 26-27 for the Echelon Philippines 2024.

Ping me. Let's connect!

### 2024-05-04 - Quick update
Slowly getting my life together and the time and ability to tackle projects. Hopefully some new technical stuff soon.

Switched from NGINX to Apache2 for the website. Redirect to SSL should be universal now.

Let me know if you have any issues!.

### 2024-04-29 - April officially suck
A terrible, terrible month for me on many fronts. However, I’m still here, still on board, and still not under indictment (that I know of). May will be better for me or I will set it on fire.

The time has come to move hosts. I’m now on a VPS that allows me the ability to do things like, offer SSL by default for free on my site, credits to where credits are due.
