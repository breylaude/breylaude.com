## 2024-04-29 - May can officially suck
A terrible, terrible month for me on many fronts. However, I’m still here, still on board, and still not under indictment (that I know of). April will be better for me or I will set it on fire.

The time has come to move hosts. I’m now on a VPS that allows me the ability to do things like, offer SSL by default for free on my site, credits to where credits are due.
