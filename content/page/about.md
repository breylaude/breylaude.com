Hi,

I programmed and designed this website and it’s additional applications solely to document my knowledge about dynamic programming, microcontrollers, security research, projects, so on - culminated in the main section of this website.

Disclaimer: I’m not a big fan of frameworks, over-designing, 13 megabyte parallax-ative homepage, and 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills (not used on this website) but after dealing with a lot of people complaining about some of my websites saying that “they look like I just finished learning HTML” because I don’t use heavy frameworks like they do, I will make sure that this website loads fast, lightweight, and still legible and gets the point across even when it looks like it’s not.

Also, I made various web apps that surmount a few technical problems, which you can use if you want. And if you want a website that exactly looks like this you can tell me, you can send a message on the contacts page or via telegram, I have already programmed a telegram bot that deals with this, or you can simply send me an email at: mail@breylaude.com .

Follow me on X .

Regards, Brey
