&lt;p>I share his criticism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday I took a two-hour LinkedIn Learning class on Agile Software Design. It was an introduction only. My first impression is that Agile is, at one level, moving a to-do list of sticky notes around on a bulletin board, assigning programming tasks to the programming team with verbal instructions and discussion about how to program something.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
