      <description>Brian Cantwell Smith is one of the many people who are far smarter than I am.&#xA;Their MIT thesis Procedural Reflection in Programming Languages, which is something else, is how I first became aware of them.&#xA;As usual, I learned the concepts presented in this post from the aforementioned paper. As such, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I should give credit to Brian for these concepts, but I will since I&amp;rsquo;m not sure to whom to give credit otherwise.</description>
