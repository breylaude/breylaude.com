      <description>I was watching some random finance lectures and it gave lectures with a list of financial advice and it starts out by &amp;ldquo;What is finance&amp;rdquo;, breakdown into two things, if you want to get into it you have a choice, you can either invest your own money or other people&amp;rsquo;s money - investing your own money probably only makes sense if you have a lot of it, you need tools to, like there&amp;rsquo;s no reason you should be investing your money if somebody else can invest it better.</description>

      <description>Brian Cantwell Smith is one of the many people who are far smarter than I am.&#xA;Their MIT thesis Procedural Reflection in Programming Languages, which is something else, is how I first became aware of them.&#xA;As usual, I learned the concepts presented in this post from the aforementioned paper. As such, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I should give credit to Brian for these concepts, but I will since I&amp;rsquo;m not sure to whom to give credit otherwise.</description>
